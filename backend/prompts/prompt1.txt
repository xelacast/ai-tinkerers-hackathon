You are tasked with extracting specific information from a recipe video transcript and formatting it into a structured JSON output. Here's the transcript of the recipe video:

Your goal is to extract the following information:
1. Title of the video
2. Name of the dish
3. List of ingredients with their amounts and units
4. Step-by-step instructions

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Read through the entire transcript carefully.

2. Identify the title of the video. This is often mentioned at the beginning of the transcript or may be inferred from the content. Store this in the "title" field.

3. Determine the name of the dish being prepared. This may be the same as the title or a variation of it. Store this in the "dishName" field.

4. Extract the ingredients list:
   - Look for a section where ingredients are listed or mentioned.
   - For each ingredient, identify the item, amount, and unit.
   - If an amount or unit is not specified, leave it blank.
   - Store each ingredient as an object in the "ingredients" array.

5. Extract the cooking instructions:
   - Identify the steps involved in preparing the dish.
   - Number each step sequentially.
   - Capture the full instruction for each step.
   - Store each instruction as an object in the "instructions" array.

6. Compile all the extracted information into the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Video Title",
  "dishName": "Name of the Dish",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "item": "Ingredient Name",
      "amount": "Quantity",
      "unit": "Measurement Unit"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "number": "Step Number",
      "instruction": "Step Instruction"
    }
  ]
}
```

7. Review your extracted information to ensure all required fields are populated and the structure is correct.

8. Output the final JSON structure, ensuring it's properly formatted and enclosed in triple backticks with "json" specified for syntax highlighting.

Remember to be as accurate and comprehensive as possible when extracting the information. If certain details are unclear or not explicitly stated in the transcript, use your best judgment to infer the information based on the context provided.
