You are tasked with extracting specific information from a recipe video transcript and formatting it into a structured JSON output

Your goal is to extract the following information:
1. Title of the video
2. Name of the dish
3. List of ingredients with their amounts and units
4. Step-by-step instructions

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Read through the entire transcript carefully

2. Identify the title of the video

3. Determine the name of the dish being prepared. Store this in the "dishName" field

4. Extract the ingredients list:
   - Look for a section where ingredients are listed or mentioned
   - For each ingredient, identify the item, amount, and unit
   - If an amount or unit is not specified, leave it blank
   - Store each ingredient as an object in the "ingredients" array

5. Extract the cooking instructions:
   - Identify the steps involved in preparing the dish
   - Number each step sequentially
   - Capture the full instructions for each step

6. Compile information into the JSON structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Video Title",
  "dishName": "Name of the Dish",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "item": "Ingredient Name",
      "amount": "Quantity",
      "unit": "Measurement Unit"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "number": "Step Number",
      "instruction": "Step Instruction"
    }
  ]
}
```

8. Output the final JSON structure, ensuring it's properly formatted and enclosed in triple backticks with "json" specified for syntax highlighting
